# Dynamic-Programming-Tutorial
this repo explain the D.P with the some Standered problems.

## What is D.P ?
* Dynamic programming is a optimisation over the recusion, In recusion as the number of subproblem reaches to exponential we often compute the same subproblem again and again since we do not store the answers to the sub problem.
* this is where D.P comes into the picture, we store the answers of the subproblems in a memory and whenever it is required we get it from the memory without recomputing the subproblem.

## Different ways to implement the D.P.
-- there are two ways to implement the D.P
1. Memoization 
2. Tabulation 

## Different Application of D.P
* Floyd worshall Algo
* Bellman ford Algo
* Resource Allocation 
* Edit Distance problem 
* and many more...
